# SSNR 2024 WS5 material

Clone the repository (if you have Git) or download the files directly by pressing the green button labelled `<> Code â–¾`. Follow the instructions inside the .pdf file to set up a python environment ready to run the files and challenges.
If you use an IDE like PyCharm or Spyder, please also read the instructions in "info_for_ide_users.txt" to set up plotting correctly.


Currently the repository houses content mostly from the 2023 version, the new material for this year will be added closer to the summer school date.
